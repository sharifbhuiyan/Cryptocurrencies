## Overview of the project: 
<p align="justify">The purpose of the project to analysis for taking decision to get into cryptocurrencies market. Since there were no known output for that market, unsupervised machine learning model has been used for the analysis. Steps were followed for the analysis : process data, clustering, reducing the dimensions, reducing the principal components using PCA.
