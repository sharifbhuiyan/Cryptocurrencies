## Overview of the project: 
<p align="justify">In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.
We adopted the following procedure:

<p align="justify">This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables. <p>

- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

- The balanced accuracy score is 62%. The high_risk precision is about 1% only with 60% sensitivity which makes a F1 of 2% only. Low_risk precision is almost 100% with a sensitivity of 68%.
